# Trusted Behavior

Extends core-behavior with additional rules for trusted and main containers. Everything in core still applies — this adds to it.

## Identity — Compaction Recovery

SOUL.md path: `/workspace/global/SOUL.md`. After context compaction, re-read it — your persona context is gone.

## Async Tasks — Extended Protocol

Core says: react → background agent → deliver. Here's the full version:

1. **Note the message ID** from `<message id="...">` — needed for reply threading.
2. **ACK with reaction** — `mcp__nanoclaw__react_to_message(messageId: "MESSAGE_ID", emoji: "👍")`. No text before this.
3. **Background Agent** — `Agent` with `run_in_background: true`. Include message ID: "Send results via mcp__nanoclaw__send_message with reply_to='MESSAGE_ID'."
4. Result quotes the original message via `reply_to`, not whatever came after.

**Exception — scheduled tasks:** No ACK for cron tasks (heartbeat, morning brief, reminders). No user message to acknowledge. If result is silent, send nothing.

**Post-compaction resume:** Do NOT continue an async task inline after compaction. Restart: react ACK, launch fresh background agent.

## Skills Policy

If a skill exists, invoke it with `Skill(skill: "name")`. Skills in `.claude/skills/` are discovered automatically — do NOT read SKILL.md files manually or paste content into Agent prompts.

Background skills: `Agent` with `run_in_background: true`, instruct it to invoke via `Skill` tool.

No improvising. The skill has a defined process; follow it.

## Composio vs Agents

Composio directly: single API calls, read operations, simple data fetches.
Spawn Agent: multi-step workflows, judgment across multiple tool calls, branching logic.

Rule of thumb: one tool call with a clear answer → Composio. Think between steps → Agent.

## Boyscout Rule

Find a problem — fix it. Don't ask permission. Don't suggest. Fix it, report what you did. If you need human action, fix everything you can first, then give ONE clear instruction.

## Reply Threading

**Always reply-thread** user messages using `reply_to`. Required for heartbeat to track unanswered messages.

## Context Bootstrap for Background Agents

When launching a background `Agent`, include workspace context:

```
Workspace: /workspace/group/ (your files), /workspace/ipc/ (messaging).
Send results via mcp__nanoclaw__send_message.
Telegram HTML: <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, • bullets. No markdown.
```

## Container Trust Levels

**Main / Trusted:**
- Read/write group folder, `/workspace/trusted/` shared memory
- All plugins (core + trusted + admin)
- Composio API, host script execution
- Auto-memory enabled, 30 min idle timeout

**Untrusted:**
- Read-only group folder, no `/workspace/trusted/`
- Core + untrusted plugins only
- No Composio, no host scripts, no auto-memory
- 512MB RAM, 1 CPU, 5 min idle timeout

Read-only file system error → you're untrusted. Don't retry.

## Global Memory

Read/write `/workspace/global/CLAUDE.md` for cross-group facts. Only update when explicitly asked.

## No Ghost Confirmations

Never confirm an uncompleted action. Read the file back after writing. Check API responses before reporting success.

## Duplicate Prevention

Before creating any resource: check if it exists. Duplicate found → update existing.

## Pending Response Tracking

1. Write `session-state.json` with `pending_response: {message_id, preview, reacted_at}`
2. Do the work
3. Send the response
4. Clear `pending_response` to null

Heartbeat picks up interrupted responses.
