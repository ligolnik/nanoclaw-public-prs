# Observer — live reasoning + status channel

The observer is an optional forwarder that mirrors a bot's reasoning, tool calls, errors, and per-query summaries into a dedicated Telegram "status" group. Built for visibility — when the bot goes quiet, you can see why.

Enable by setting `OBSERVER_CHAT_JID=tg:-100…` in `.env` or the launchd plist.

## What the user sees

In the status group, while the bot is working:

```
🧠 [telegram_main] User wants me to refresh smartthings — let me check what's stale first…
🧠 [telegram_main] 12 devices need updating, I'll start with the office…
🔧 [telegram_main] Bash latency=243ms ok
❌ [telegram_main] [msg #14] tool_result id=… error: 429 Too Many Requests
🧠 [telegram_main] Rate-limited — falling back to the built-in retry…
```

When the query ends, a single summary line:

```
✅ [telegram_main] 🧠 7 thinking | 🔧 4 tools: smartthings_get_history, send_message | wall=8.4s | tokens 23 in / 1.2k out | cache 91.0%
```

Reaction emoji on the user's original message in their chat (not the status group) cycles through:

| Emoji | When |
|---|---|
| 👀 | Message received, queued for the agent |
| 🤔 | First thinking block streamed |
| ⚡ | First tool call started |
| ✍ | `send_message` tool fired (composing reply) |
| 🔥 / ⚡ blink | Watchdog active — query is taking >30s |

The user's chat also gets a polite "still working" message from the watchdog at 60s, 120s, 300s thresholds so they know it's alive.

## Architecture

Five layers, each thin and replaceable:

## Key design decisions and the things that bit us

### 1. The thinking parameter must be `display: 'summarized'`

The Claude SDK call configures:

```ts
thinking: { type: 'adaptive', display: 'summarized' }
```

`type: 'adaptive'` enables interleaved thinking (model thinks between tool calls, not just upfront — critical for agentic workflows). `display: 'summarized'` is the part Anthropic changed the default of in Opus 4.7 — without it, thinking blocks come back with `thinking: ""` plus a long `signature` blob (the reasoning is encrypted server-side for streaming speed). The observer sees nothing.

Older models default to `'summarized'`, so you might not notice the silent regression on a model upgrade. Pin it explicitly.

Source: [Anthropic Extended Thinking docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) — *"On Claude Opus 4.7 and later, `display` defaults to `'omitted'` rather than returning thinking content. Pass `display: 'summarized'` to receive summarized thinking."*

### 2. Stringly-typed wire format (tradeoff: cheap, fragile)

The agent-runner serializes thinking → log line → orchestrator captures stderr → observer regex-matches. If anyone changes the log format, the observer goes silent without erroring.

Why we chose it: zero infrastructure (no extra IPC files, no new protocol), works with any container runtime, easy to debug from `docker logs`. The log line is also human-readable for post-mortem analysis.

If you're going to fork this: a typed JSON-Lines IPC channel from agent-runner to orchestrator would be more robust — but the regex has been stable across many model upgrades, so the cost-benefit hasn't tipped yet.

### 3. Chunking, because Telegram caps messages at 4096 chars

Long thinking blocks (a 1000-word reasoning chain) blow past the per-message limit. `chunkText()` splits at the nearest whitespace within the last 200 chars before the boundary, tags chunks `(1/N)`, sends sequentially so they arrive in order. Failure of one chunk doesn't abort the rest — partial visibility beats none.

We initially capped thinking at 400 chars in the agent-runner just to dodge this, then realized the cap also lost data from `docker logs`. Lifted the cap, moved the responsibility to the observer's send path.

### 4. Per-source state isolation

The observer maintains a `Map<folder, QueryState>` so concurrent queries (main DM + several group chats running at once) don't cross-contaminate. Each query's reasoning, tool count, and reaction state lives under its container's group folder.

State is created on `Query input:`, deleted on `Query done.`. The reaction emoji map (`lastReactionEmoji`) is keyed by chat JID, separate from the per-folder query state, because reactions live on user-side messages while query state lives in the agent-runner.

### 5. Watchdog: blinks + threshold pings

A long query with no chat output looks like the bot hung. Two mechanisms:

- **Reaction blink** every 30s — alternates between two valid Telegram emojis (`⚡` and `🔥`) so the user sees the message status changing, even if no text has been sent.
- **Threshold pings** at 60s / 120s / 300s — sends a short italic "still working — Xs in, N tools so far" reply to the user's chat. Once each, never spammed.

Both stop the moment `Query done.` lands.

### 6. Reaction emojis must be in Telegram's allowlist

Telegram only allows bot reactions from a specific fixed set. Anything else silently falls back to 👍 and defeats the visual signal. The valid set is duplicated in `src/channels/telegram.ts` as `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_REACTIONS` — when adding a new state to the reaction state machine, pick one from there.

This bit us once when we used `🔧` for "tools" — wasn't on the allowlist, every tool call rendered as 👍 and the signal was useless. Switched to `⚡`.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `container/agent-runner/src/index.ts` | Emits `[msg #N] thinking=…` / `tool_use=…` / `tool_result=…` log lines from SDK message events |
| `src/container-runner.ts` (line ~1365) | Tails container stderr, calls `onAgentLine(folder, line)` for each |
| `src/observer.ts` | Parses lines, maintains per-query state, sends to status group, manages reactions, runs watchdog |
| `src/index.ts` | `initObserver(channels, () => registeredGroups)` wiring + `noteLatestUserMessage` calls from telegram channel handler |

## Enabling

1. Create a Telegram group, add the bot, register it in NanoClaw with any folder name. (No special config — just a normal group.)
2. Find its JID with `sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT jid, name FROM registered_groups"`.
3. Set `OBSERVER_CHAT_JID=tg:-100…` in `.env` or the launchd plist's `EnvironmentVariables`.
4. Restart the orchestrator. Look for `Observer chat enabled` in the log on startup.

## Disabling

Unset `OBSERVER_CHAT_JID`. The observer becomes a no-op — every callback path returns early via `observerEnabled()`. No code change required.

## What this is *not*

- **Not** a replacement for proper logging or metrics. `docker logs` and orchestrator JSON logs remain authoritative; the observer is a UX layer for live debugging in chat.
- **Not** a security boundary. Any user with read access to the status group sees the full reasoning of every query in every chat. Treat the JID like a credential — don't share it.
- **Not** a feedback loop into the agent. The observer reads the agent's stderr; it doesn't influence what the agent does. Reactions are display-only.
