# Full NanoClaw deployment — single command, no manual steps.
#
# Usage: ssh nas "cd ~/nanoclaw && ./scripts/deploy.sh"
#    or: ssh nas "cd ~/nanoclaw && ./scripts/deploy.sh --tiles-only"
#
# Steps:
#   1. Pull latest code from origin
#   2a. Rebuild agent-runner image (must precede 2b — see #69)
#   2b. Rebuild orchestrator image (`docker compose up -d --build`
#       recreates the running container as a side effect of the rebuild)
#   3. Update tiles from registry
#   4. Kill ALL running agent containers (forces fresh tile load)
#   5. Clear ALL sessions from DB
#   6. Restart orchestrator
#
# The --tiles-only flag skips the git pull and orchestrator rebuild
# (for when only tile content changed, not source code).

# Read CONTAINER_IMAGE from .env if it isn't already set in the shell,
# so this script and `docker compose` see the same source of truth.
# `docker compose` reads .env directly when interpolating
# `${CONTAINER_IMAGE:-...}`; without this lookup, a `.env`-only setting
# would be visible to compose but invisible to this script — silent
# divergence, "we rebuild what the orchestrator spawns" stops being
# true.
#
# Two design choices worth preserving:
#   1. Parse `.env` as data, NOT `source .env`. Sourcing executes the
#      file as shell code — any unexpected/malicious content runs on
#      the host. We only want one specific KEY=VALUE, not arbitrary
#      shell.
#   2. Shell-exported values WIN over `.env`. That matches `docker
#      compose`'s precedence (shell env overrides .env). Without this
#      check, `set -a + source .env` would overwrite an explicit shell
#      export — operator surprise.

    # `grep -m1` stops after the first match — a single tool, no `head`
    # pipe (which would close stdin and hand grep a SIGPIPE under
    # `set -o pipefail`). `|| true` swallows the no-match exit-1 so a
    # `.env` that doesn't define CONTAINER_IMAGE leaves us at the
    # default rather than aborting the script under `set -e`.

# 5. Gracefully close agent containers (#221).
#
# Pre-#221 this step ran `docker kill` on every nanoclaw-* container
# unconditionally — exit 137 across every in-flight conversation
# turn and scheduled-task run, even when the agent was 100ms from
# completing its reply. The rationale was "force fresh tile load
# after rebuild", but for the typical agent that's mid-query, the
# right behaviour is "let it finish its current turn, exit cleanly,
# next message spawns a fresh container with new tiles".
#
# Pattern: write the agent-runner's `_close` IPC sentinel into each
# agent's input dir, give them a grace window to exit naturally,
# then force-kill any holdouts (genuinely-stuck agents in long tool
# calls beyond the grace). User-visible: at most one stale-tile
# turn per group per deploy (the in-flight turn), instead of every
# in-flight turn destroyed mid-stream.
#
# `_close` semantics live in `container/agent-runner/src/index.ts`
# (search `IPC_INPUT_CLOSE_SENTINEL`). The agent-runner polls every
# IPC_POLL_MS (~0.5s), so signal-to-exit latency is dominated by
# the current SDK turn, not the polling loop. 30s grace is generous
# for typical turns; longer tool calls fall through to the
# pre-#221 force-kill path.
#
# Mount discovery uses `docker inspect` to find the bind mount whose
# Destination is `/workspace/ipc/input`. That destination path is a
# constant in the agent-runner (`IPC_INPUT_DIR`), so all agents
# share it regardless of group/session — much simpler than
# reverse-engineering the group folder + session name from the
# container's name suffix (which would also be ambiguous: group
# folders containing underscores get sanitised to dashes in the
# container name, losing the original spelling).
